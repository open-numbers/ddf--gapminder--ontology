PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2011 international dollars.,"Gapminder based on World Bank, A. Maddison, M. Lindgren, IMF & more.","This data is compiled by Gapminder mainly from these sources: a. World Bank: For the period 1990 to 2018, data is identical to The World Bank's indicator: GDP per capita constant PPP 2011, (except for a few countries with no data in World Bank). See: gapm.io/xwb171, b. Maddison Project Database and Penn World Table of the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, University of Groningen: Data before 1990, is based  mainly on GDP per capita PPP( contanst 2011 International $) data from Maddison Project database (MPD) V2018.The MPD builts on Angus Maddison's original dataset and is revised when there  is more and better information available see:gapm.io/xmpd2018, Penn World Table v9.1:gapm.io/xpwt9-1  and  Gapminder's historic estimates by Mattias Lindgren, which mainly uses Maddison data. See: gapm.io/histdata, c. IMF: Data after 2018 uses IMF's forecasts for GDP per capita WEO 2019, October edition:gapm.io/ximf2019oct, d. The IMF forecast reaches only to 2024. Beyond that point we have extended the series to 2040, with the hypothetical assumption, that all countries converge to a modest economic growth rate of 2%. The forecasts we only use to project how the world would look like. About geographic boundaries: In order to make it easy for people to follow the development of the countries they are familiar with. Our data refer to countries in the past as if they always had the boundaries they have today. Historic territories, such as USSR may sometimes also have estimates in out datatables, so be careful not to sum all rows into a total, as you will then double count many people.
